# TERA Launcher for Linux

A community-created Linux launcher for TERA Online. This project is a **port** (in the loosest terms imaginable) of a closed-source TERA launcher ([original here](https://github.com/justkeepquiet/tera-launcher)) designed to work on retail servers. It utilizes the original launcher's graphical assets to provide a comparable experience for Linux users. By integrating Wine, it allows you to launch the TERA Online game client seamlessly on various Linux distributions.

> **Note about support:** Use the *officially provided launcher for the TERA Online service you are using* **unless** it does not work on Linux. Likewise, do not direct support requests for this launcher to the maintainers of said service.
>
> This is maintained by a single person in their spare time. Expect delays if you inquire about bugs or ask questions, but I will respond as time allows.

> **Disclaimer:** This launcher is in the it-will-probably-work-but-is-quirked-up phase of development. It will continue to see improvements—probably! As this launcher depends on third-party graphical assets and its target TERA server is baked in at compile time, we will *not* be distributing binaries.

> **Not officially supported:** This is **not** an officially supported launcher by the publishers of TERA Online. This software is provided for **educational and convenience purposes only**, and **users must respect TERA Online’s Terms of Service** and any other policies set by the game’s publishers.

## Features

* Seamlessly launches TERA Online on Linux via Wine (see **Usage** for details).
* Imports the original launcher's graphical assets to mimic its look and feel.
* Automatic game client patching and update checks.
* Modular build using CMake and subprojects for easy maintenance.

---

## Dependencies and Requirements

To build and run this launcher natively, you will need:

* **CMake** (version 3.16 or later)
* A **C compiler** (e.g., `gcc`) and build tools (such as `make`)
* **winegcc** (for building the stub-launcher component)
* **Python 3** (used by a custom asset-fetching script)
* **GTK4** development libraries
* **libcurl** development libraries
* **OpenSSL** development libraries
* **SQLite3** development libraries
* **jansson** development libraries
* **libprotobuf-c** development libraries
* **MiniXML** development libraries
* An internet connection (for asset fetching)

This has been tested to build on:

* Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
* Fedora 42 Workstation
* Arch Linux

> **Note:** If you only intend to build via **AppImage Mode**, you do **not** need to install these host dependencies locally — the Docker container provides all necessary tools and libraries.

### Ubuntu/Debian-based

```bash
sudo apt update

                 libsqlite3-dev libjansson-dev libprotobuf-c-dev \
                 libmxml-dev pkg-config git
```

### Fedora/RHEL-based

```bash
sudo dnf install gcc gcc-c++ cmake make wine-devel \
                 python3 python3-pip python3-setuptools \
                 gtk4-devel libcurl-devel openssl-devel \
                 sqlite-devel jansson-devel protobuf-c-devel \
                 mxml-devel pkg-config git
```

             python python-pip \
             gtk4 curl openssl sqlite jansson \
             protobuf-c mxml pkgconf git
```

## Docker Installation

If you be doing an AppImage build, you will need Docker. Follow the official instructions for your distribution:

* **Ubuntu 24.04**: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
* **Fedora**: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/)
* **Arch Linux**: [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Docker](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Docker)

I cannot offer support for installing or configuring Docker itself. **Use online documentation to figure out such things on your own.**

Support for **the build script** and **the build image** and build failures in an otherwise properly configured Docker configuration are however something I can support.

---

## Building

You can build this launcher in **two** ways. **AppImage Mode** is the **recommended** approach for cross‑distro convenience.

### AppImage Mode (Recommended)

> **Requirement:** The resulting AppImage will **not** work on Linux distros whose GLIBC < 2.38.

1. **Clone** the repository as usual:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PopusBenedictus/tera-launcher-for-linux.git
   cd tera-launcher-for-linux
   ```

2. **Enter** the AppImage build directory and build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   cd appimage
   docker build -t tera-builder .
   ```

3. **Generate** the AppImage:

   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it \
     -v "$(pwd)/..:/src" \
     -w /src/appimage \
     tera-builder bash -lc "./build-appimage.sh"
   ```

   After completion, you’ll find `TERA_Launcher_for_Linux-x86_64.AppImage` in the project root.

#### Optional Build Parameters

The `build-appimage.sh` script supports customization via environment variables:

* `REPO_URL` — Repository URL to clone (default: host mount)
* `BRANCH` — Git branch to build (default: `main`)
* `CLONE_REPO` — `1` to clone inside container instead of mounting (default: `0`)
* `GE_PROTON_VERSION` — Proton GE version (default: `GE-Proton10-7`)
* `GE_PROTON_URL` — Custom URL for Proton tarball

**Example:** Build from branch `dev` using GE-Proton v10.8

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$(pwd)/..:/src" \
  -w /src/appimage \
  -e BRANCH=dev \
  -e GE_PROTON_VERSION=GE-Proton10-8 \
  tera-builder bash -lc "./build-appimage.sh"
```

### Standard Build (Option 2)

Follow the original CMake-based instructions:

1. **Clone** and configure your `launcher-config.json`:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PopusBenedictus/tera-launcher-for-linux.git
   cd tera-launcher-for-linux
   # edit launcher-config.json as needed
   ```

2. **Create** a build directory and run CMake:

   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   # or with custom config:
   # cmake .. -DCUSTOM_CONFIG_PATH="/path/to/launcher-config.json"
   ```

3. **Build**:

   ```bash
   cmake --build .
   ```

---

## Configuring `launcher-config.json`

Before building, populate **all** values (except `public_launcher_assets`) in `launcher-config.json`:

```json
{
  "auth_url":              "https://some.url/LauncherLoginAction",
  "public_patch_url":      "https://some.url/public/patch",
  "public_launcher_assets_url": "https://some.url/public/launcher/images",
  "server_list_url":       "https://some.url/ServerList?lang=en",

  "wine_prefix_name":      ".config_prefix_root/wineprefix",
  "config_prefix_name":    ".config_prefix_root/config",
  "game_prefix_name":      ".config_prefix_root/files",
  "game_lang":             "EUR",

  "public_launcher_assets": [
    "bg.jpg",
    "btn-auth.png",
    "logo.png",
    "..."
  ],

  "service_name":          "Your TERA Server"
}
```

> **Note:** Outside AppImage Mode, `game_prefix_name` is ignored; `wine_prefix_name` and `config_prefix_name` are still honored. These are relative paths from your home directory.

---

## Where the Binaries Go

* **Standard build:** Binaries appear in `build/bin`. Copy them next to your game client:

  ```bash
  cp build/bin/* /path/to/TERA_game_folder/
  ```

* **AppImage build:** The single `.AppImage` contains everything. Make it executable and run:

  ```bash
  chmod +x TERA_Launcher_for_Linux-x86_64.AppImage
  ./TERA_Launcher_for_Linux-x86_64.AppImage
  ```

---

## Usage

* **Standard launcher:**

  ```bash
  ./tera_launcher_for_linux
  ```

* **AppImage launcher:**

  ```bash
  ./TERA_Launcher_for_Linux-x86_64.AppImage
  ```

You can customize the taskbar icon for the AppImage by replacing `appimage/assets/tera-launcher.png` with a 512×512 PNG of your choice. Do this before building the AppImage.
